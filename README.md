# Overview

The purpose of this project was to visualize an array of UFO sightings that was documented all across the world. We did this by creating a webpage that told our story and had a table of other sightings. You can filter through this table to find the exact sighting you want or to see if your city has had some strange visitors.

# Results

The webpage is a great way of showing our data. Its clean and easy to read so its not hard for someone to understand what we are trying to show.
