# Overview

The purpose of this project was to visualize an array of UFO sightings that was documented all across the world. We did this by creating a webpage that told our story and had a table of other sightings. You can filter through this table to find the exact sighting you want or to see if your city has had some strange visitors.

# Results

The webpage is a great way of showing our data. Its clean and easy to read so its not hard for someone to understand what we are trying to show. Our table is shown below, as you can see we made it clear and easy to tell that we have boxes on the left hand side that will take your input and filter the table occordingly. ![](https://github.com/RonHolcomb/UFO_Sightings/blob/main/Screenshot%20(26).png) ![](https://github.com/RonHolcomb/UFO_Sightings/blob/main/Screenshot%20(27).png)

# Summary

Although this is a solid display of data it can still be improved upon. We are limiting ourselves to just the data on the table, even though there is a lot of data, this does not prove there were real sightings. If we gather more data of sightings that are backed by news articles as well as pictures we can further prove our point. We can add a section to our table that includes an article about the documented sighting. We can also include images from a few of the sightings somewhere on the webpage that, when clicked on, also go to a credible news article.
